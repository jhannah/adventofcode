My test runs / results. Your results will be different because the AoC website
changes the input files (day1.txt, day2.txt, ...) for each user.

✗ perl day1.pl
Part 1: floor: -1
Part 2: position: 5

✗ perl day1.pl < day1.txt
Part 1: floor: 280
Part 2: position: 1797

✗ perl day2.pl
Part 1: paper:  101
Part 2: ribbon: 48

✗ perl day2.pl < day2.txt
